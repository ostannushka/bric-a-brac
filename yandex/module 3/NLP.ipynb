    "Natural language processing оказалась принципиально новой задачей, потребовавшей много времени и сил. В ней важную роль играет этап превращения текста в признаки, понятные моделям. В данном проекте это реализовано с помощью TF-IDF, в ходе работы стало понятно, что имеет значение не только тип векторизотора, но и количество признаков, которое он генерирует. При слишком большом и слишком маленьком количестве признаков страдает качество обучения моделей. При этом лучшую метрику качества f1 показала модель логистической регрессии, возможно потому что ей проще всего работать с векторизированными признаками."
