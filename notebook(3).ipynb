    "Лучшей моделью для прогнозирования количества заказов в час оказался lightgbm regressor, также в заданный порог попадает CatBoostRegressor. Согласно анализу Feature importances подход этих моделей несколько различался. Обе модели единогласно приняли за самый важный признак время суток - час, это было понятно ещё на этапе анализа данных, были выявлены четкие суточные колебания количества вызовов. Далее LGBM опирался на значение скользящего среднего, которое усредняло окружающие 8 значений, а CatBoost c гораздо меньшей важностью учитывал значение Lag_1. "
